Generic:

- ``LicenseCheckBear`` - Checks given files for license. Searches start or
  end of files for lines belonging to various licenses.

coala-bears 0.10.1
==================

Bugfixes:

- Remark dependency has been pinned back to ~5.4 because version 6 changes
  current behavior and breaks tests. This is a hotfix which will be rolled
  back when the upstream addresses this.

coala-bears 0.10.0
==================

This release, we had 97 commits contributed by 42 contributors.

The coala website has been updated to a new, more modern design. You can now
find a quick overview of bears and their settings at
http://coala.io/#!/languages. We also have sample a bear output on the front
page for some common languages.

Separation of bear dependencies from the ``coala_bears`` package is planned. This
release will keep the same behavior as previous releases. However to keep
current installation behavior in the future, please use the pip package index
option ``[alldeps]`` as in ``pip3 install coala_bears[alldeps]``.

Here are the important changes and additions. This release tracks coala 0.10.
please see the coala release notes for the improvements in this version.

**Deleted Settings:**

- `CSecurityBear` does not accept a `neverignore` setting anymore. Those kinds
  of issues are and should be consistently handled by coala.

**Deprecated Settings:**

- The `ignore_regex` setting from `InvalidLinkBear` was deprecated in favour of
  `link_ignore_regex` for more clarity in coafiles.
- `KeywordBear` accepts only one `keywords` argument. The `ci_keywords` and
  `cs_keywords` arguments have been deprecated.

  `use_es6_syntax` argument. The latter has been deprecated in favour of the
  former.

  instead of the `allow_global_strict` which has been deprecated.

  a commonly chosen setting.
